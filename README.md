# bootstrap_baseconfig
Set Base Parameters and minimum Designs for base FSO

Within this Baseconfig, Set the minimum Basic CSS Stuff which has to be set every time in a new Custom DB. All improvements within a customer and learned new should be implemented here to keep this Work save and safe time for future custom buildings as well.

## Working:
- Production or New Instance NOW: 
  Just open the Customizer and fill with customers basic parameters ... and edit followind the defined List of minimum things

## TODO:
- Find Basic Fields which needs to be set and create a List for the korrelated Fields within the Customize tool of Bootstrap to the Odoo Basics so that its Clear what does what within Odoo when set in the Cutomizer Tool of Bootstrap 
- Link this Module into new "customer repo" or find best way to do it...
- Define basic Settings which are changed all the Time and we want to have 
- define basic Customer Parameters "Color, font, Sizes, jump markers aso....) 
   example: this is asked at the customer side for /meine-daten as minimum

Production or new Instance FUTURE: IDEA
- When on Customers Side create a "umfrage" in Odoo or extend Mikes automation tool for cusomer pillar editings.....
- Create a base config Editor for the Customize.ini File of Bootstrap customizer to edit Basic Settings for the customer
After the new Instance is created and this file has been written it should automaticaly update the bootstrap_customize.ini. 
This might be an aproach to decrase the CSS changes.
